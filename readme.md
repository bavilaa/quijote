# Don Quixote

It was written in the XVII century by Miguel de Cervantes and it's the most famous book of spanish speakers.Four centuries later,  Its teachings are still being valid --- If you can understand it and you don't go mad in the process ---

In this project I want to make his fame bigger in non spanish speakers and in the process make some funny things using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning methods.
